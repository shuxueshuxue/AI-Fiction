# AI-Fiction

> If AI is neither artificial nor natural, then what exactly is it?

Scientists debate whether AI truly understands the physical world. Mathematicians puzzle over black boxes and wonder if machines really reason. Economists warn of mass unemployment. Philosophers chase the ghost of consciousness.

Yet we miss something fundamental: How does a culture built over millennia make room for something it has no category for?

We have no words for what AI is. No legal precedent for what it does. No moral framework that applies. Those who grew up before this age find themselves strangers in their own world, grasping for analogies that always fall short.

A collection of stories exploring these questions, all sharing the same worldbuilding.

Set in tomorrow, but about today—when AI is here and culture hasn't caught up.
